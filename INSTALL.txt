Novel Dispatch (NDSP) minimalism deployment instructions

We understand that it might be difficult to get started with a brand new server application, 
so please follow the essential steps below if you wish to make the application usable in the shortest time.

1. Enable the Internet Information Services (IIS) feature in your Windows operating system.
Be sure to enable ASP.NET (Version 4.5) features in the process.

2. Place "default.aspx" in the "C:\inetpub\wwwroot" directory and delete other default files in this directory.

3. Create a directory "C:\ProgramData\Novel Dispatch" and place "config.txt" and "push.html" into this directory.

4. Use Notepad to edit the newly created "config.txt" and replace "D:\" and "E:\" 
with different paths that eventually exist on the server, for sharing with the users on the network.

Your application should now work by accessing "http://127.0.0.1", and the default login is "admin/admin".

Please note that:

+ NDSP permission control is independent of the Windows operating system.
For all shared directories, you need to grant access permissions to the "IIS_IUSRS" user group 
on the Windows operating system side if there is no permission by default.

++ NDSP uses the form of user groups for permission control. It is not intended to have too many user groups.
If you need an independent user management system, 
you should create a third-party application with the access to the NDSP API.

+++ NDSP does not have a built-in file upload client. But we have provided a demo client page "push.html", 
which also can be used in production environments, for user references.
